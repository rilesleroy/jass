# JASS - Just, Alright Stack System

JASS is a simple stack based language designed for very basic conatenation based automation.

I built JASS as a debug tool and to help with automating the testing of games but its also been usful in building other GUI applications.

I use JASS to allow me to maniulation the runtime state of a host program using commands that the host program provides.




## Runtime command definitions
Users can define new commands at runtime by using the built in "read forward" `def` command.

```
def new_command sub_command sub_command sub_command
```

To run a new command you can simple invoke it
```
rile.run_line("line_string")
```
